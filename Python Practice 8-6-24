#Exception handling in Python
Exception handling is important in programming because it helps prevent programs from crashing when unexpected errors occur.exceptional situations that may occur during the execution of your code. In Python, this is done using TRY and EXCEPT blocks.

try:
    # Code block where an exception might occur
    # You try to execute this code
    # If an exception occurs, it jumps to the except block
except ExceptionType:
    # Code block to handle the exception
    # This block only executes if the specified exception occurs in the try block
else:
    # Optional block that executes if no exception occurs in the try block
finally:
    # Optional block that always executes, regardless of whether an exception occurs or not

#example
try:
    # Open a file
    file = open("example.txt", "r")
    # Perform some operations
    # For example, read lines from the file
    lines = file.readlines()
    # Close the file
    file.close()
except FileNotFoundError:
    print("File not found!")
else:
    print("File successfully read.")
finally:
    print("Execution completed.")
#IndentationError
An IndentationError occurs when there is an incorrect indentation in the code.



#Inheritance:
#Inheritance provides code reusability to the program because we can use an existing class to create a new class instead of creating it from scratch.
